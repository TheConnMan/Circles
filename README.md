Circles
=======

### Play at [theconnman.github.io/Circles](http://theconnman.com/Circles/) ###

###GOAL:###
The goal of each level is to create as large of a bubble as possible without it touching the moving circles. Clicking on the game will create a small bubble which gets larger with a constant speed. The bubble stops growing when any other circle runs into it. To pass the level you need to reach a size of over 100. If you beat the first 10 levels you get to create custom levels of your own.

###HOW TO PLAY:###
At first there will be a few slow moving circles. Click anywhere on the board (probably in a space where other circles are moving away) and a bubble will begin to grow. There is a threshold size for the bubble to advance to the next level. Each level has more, faster moving obstacles.
